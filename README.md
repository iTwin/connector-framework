## Changelog and Tagging

Ideally for any PR created for this repo there is a Github release created to describe the changes being made in said PR.
Details on how to go about creating a release can be found here: (https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository). Contents can be brief, only providing high level descriptions of what is different from a user perspective, with examples of how to use new utilities if applicable, and including a link to the PR for the changes. 

For each release it should also be tagged with a tag fitting for the release (eg. Nightly or Beta for non-major releases) You can select a prexisting tag or create this tag during the creation of the github release process by filling out the field labeled "Tag".
